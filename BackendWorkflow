# Technical Aspects of Submitting to Arceli

[in active development]

PressForward site collects all the content via RSS feeds and allows it be moderated.

Content can be nominated manually with PressForward [Nominate This bookmarklet](https://github.com/PressForward/pressforward/wiki/User-Manual#installing-and-using-the-nominate-this-bookmarklet)

Workflow for Zenodo will borrow from [Making Your Code Citable](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/).
A hook from PressForward WP will allow for communications to be deposited in Zenodo/Arceli communities after they are moderated/reviewed.
